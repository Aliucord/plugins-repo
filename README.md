# plugins-repo

The internal repository for Aliucord plugin listings

## Adding your own plugins

Congrats, you made your own plugin! There's only a few more steps that you
have to complete in order to get it listed and be available directly within Aliucord.

1. Ensure your plugin repository has a successful CI build (the green checkmark/actions tab)
2. Fill out a new issue here with this template:
   [Add Repository](https://github.com/Aliucord/plugins-repo/issues/new?template=add-repository.yml)
3. Wait until one of us reviews your repository (to ensure nothing malicious),
   after which your plugins will be immediately listed on the global plugin repository!
4. Ask one of us in Aliucord's Discord server to give you permissions to post in the `#plugins-list`
   and `#new-plugins` channels! This is the old way plugins used to be downloaded and it is still heavily used.
